Giving to –
the next generation
of outrageous ambition
Because We Are Forever Duke
Every gift to Duke – large or small – plays a role in pushing us forward. They allow research into uncovering the next impossible discovery, financial aid ensuring the best and brightest always have a spot, and top faculty to train future leaders and advance new fields. In other words, Duke isn’t Duke without you.
Duke Isn’t Duke
Without You
Are you MADE FOR THIS?
MADE FOR THIS
Commencing publicly in February 2025, the MADE FOR THIS campaign for Duke University will seek to engage our global community of alumni and friends to help Duke meet its highest ambitions. Our campaign will extend our value and impact to the world in areas where we know we can make a difference: science and technology, student experience, health and climate.
Thanks to financial aid, all students are
afforded the opportunity
to pursue their greatest ambitions and benefit from the Duke experience.

Our research not only discovers answers to some of the world’s most pressing challenges – it changes lives for the better. Your gifts help us to strip away the divisions between departments, so that ideas flourish at the intersection of health, science, technology and the humanities. Faculty and work side by side with graduates and undergraduates, amplifying new voices and preparing students to confront the challenges of the future.

Faculty Support
Duke faculty is the best of the best. They not only make a difference through their research and scholarship to advance new fields, but in the students they train and mentor as future leaders. Answers to complex problems require multiple and inclusive perspectives, and your support helps to recruit and retain the next generation of diverse and superb faculty that make that possible.

Campus transformation
Duke’s campus is timeless, but we constantly strive to elevate it into a class of its own. We tear down divisional boundaries and establish collision spaces for innovative research across departments, such as humanities and medicine or computer science and philosophy. We create space inside and out of the classroom that enhance the way students live, learn and grow. Your support allows us to continue providing the highest level of academic life and patient care for a vibrant, diverse and exceptional campus community.
