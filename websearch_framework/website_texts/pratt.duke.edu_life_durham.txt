Life in Durham
Where Tech Town Opportunity Meets Southern Hospitality
For a century, Duke University has been seamlessly woven into the tapestry of Durham—a vibrant city in North Carolina that The New York Times describes as “re-energized by a youth-driven renaissance.”
With its rich history, distinctive character and thriving economy, it’s no wonder Durham is consistently ranked as one of the best places to live in the United States.
