Challenge yourself. Change
your
world.
DukeEngage exists for students to practice doing the
external
work of addressing social issues and the
internal
work of deciding how to show up in the world.
What is DukeEngage?
DukeEngage’s central program is an eight-week, immersive summer experience for Duke undergraduates involving full-time volunteer work, community engagement, and daily reflection. We also offer the DukeEngage Gateway program, a scaled-down version of this experience for incoming first-year students, and the Brodhead and Decaminada Fellowships for students who have completed a summer of DukeEngage.

Partnership, Immersion, Reflection
Partnership
Throughout the summer, students work with Duke faculty alongside local partners to address societal issues while learning how communities develop solutions and create change. More than just an internship, DukeEngage includes deep involvement in the life of a community.
Immersion
The breadth of DukeEngage’s U.S.-based and international immersion programs, which place students in communities worldwide for a minimum of eight weeks, is a cornerstone of the experience.
Reflection
Reflection is the process of deriving meaning from experience. It provides the structure in which we translate experience into knowledge and is a crucial component of every DukeEngage program. During DukeEngage, students participate in structured reflection to discover connection between purpose, action, consequence, and change.
