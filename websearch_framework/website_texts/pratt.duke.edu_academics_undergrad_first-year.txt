Your First Year
This is Going to be Great
Your first year as a Duke engineering student is more than just a course schedule. It’s an immersive experience that sets you up for long-term success.
Welcome Class of 2029!
You’re about to receive what we call the Duke Engineering Signature Experience. It will be an amazing year.
On the first day
, you’ll dive into
hands-on design projects
and begin to
think like a programmer
.
You’ll gain key skills over the fall and spring, including critical thinking and effective academic writing. You’ll build up stores of grit and resilience. And, we’ll start a sustained conversation about your sense of purpose.
Our Team Approach to Advising
No one goes through our First Year Experience alone. Far from it. Our team approach to advising surrounds students with
supportive coaching through 360 degrees
.
At the end of your first year, you’ll be proud (and a little amazed) of all you’ve accomplished. Plus, you’ll feel confident going into Year 2, knowing you’ve got what it takes to be a Duke Engineer.
