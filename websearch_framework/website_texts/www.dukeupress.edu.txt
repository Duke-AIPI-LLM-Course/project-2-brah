The Years of Blood: Stories from a Reporting Life in Latin America by Alma Guillermoprieto
"For decades now, Alma Guillermoprieto has been an indispensable guide to a region that US opinion makers stubbornly continue to ignore.
The Years of Blood
is Guillermoprieto at her most intense and nuanced, offering humane portraits set in turbulent landscapes, some of ordinary people trying to survive, others of people with extraordinary power who believe they control the turbulence. An indispensable window into a region that, even as it remains itself, is changing with breakneck speed."—Greg Grandin

Hemispheric Blackface
Danielle Roper
“By considering the Americas as an expansive geographic unit, Danielle Roper demonstrates how a black studies methodology cuts through the foundational fictions that obscure or romanticize the structural and cultural implications of the afterlives of slavery and colonization. In so doing, she disrupts what otherwise might be considered area studies or nation-centered models by showing how multiracial societies rely on practices and tropes of antiblackness. An outstanding and timely book.”
- Donette Francis, author of
Fictions of Feminine Citizenship: Sexuality and the Nation in Contemporary Caribbean Literature
Abolitionist Intimacies
Eithne Luibhéid
“Building on her record as a foremost scholar of immigration, Eithne Luibhéid offers powerful and innovative heuristics for thinking about how queer and trans migrants and their allies leverage their intimacies to resist deportation infrastructures and build abolitionist futures. Thoroughly researched, masterfully argued, and elegantly written,
Abolitionist Intimacies
will shift how you think about immigration regimes, but more importantly, it will change what you believe is possible for changing them.”
- Karma R. Chavez, author of
The Borders of AIDS: Race, Quarantine, and Resistance
DeepAesthetics
Anna Munster
“
DeepAesthetics
offers a fascinating movement across a triadic relation between critical engagements with artworks, close analyses of machine learning, and the interrogation of both via speculative pragmatism. It will doubtless be of interest to media artists and scholars working in science and technology studies, art practice, cultural and media theory, aesthetic theory, and the philosophy and ethics of artificial intelligence.”
- Matthew Fuller, author of
How To Be a Geek: Essays on the Culture of Software
Quiet Dawn
Jean-Claude Fignolé
“From a virtuoso of Haitian literature comes this stunning whorl of history, revolution, love, and politics. With vivid authority, Jean-Claude Fignolé offers an intriguing and painful saga of a colonial family moving through history, painting portraits of many of the towering figures from Haiti’s colonial past. He situates a living, pulsing Haiti directly where it should be: at the axis of the twirling vortex of post-seventeenth-century Western history. It’s a pleasure to read this book and a lesson, as well, about how we can interpret the legacy of the crowded Atlantic drama in our day.”
- Amy Wilentz, author of
Farewell, Fred Voodoo: A Letter from Haiti
Living and Dying in São Paulo
Jeffrey Lesser
“
Living and Dying in São Paulo
is methodologically innovative, conceptually powerful, and engagingly written. Jeffrey Lesser’s book has rare precision and creativity. Not only does he give an insightful reading of place and people, he also makes a bold case for historians to adopt new approaches and for those in the social and biomedical sciences to pose questions historically. This is the kind of writing I am sure most historians—myself included—wish they could do.”
- Jerry Dávila, author of
Hotel Trópico: Brazil and the Challenge of African Decolonization, 1950–1980
The Future of Futurity
Purnima Mankekar, Akhil Gupta
“What is it like to travel every night while staying firmly in place? What new affects and imaginaries emerge via laboring in the temporally upside-down life of an Indian call center? Purnima Mankekar and Akhil Gupta explore not only the fierce demands of such globally distributed labor but also the hopes and dreams of online workers seeking access to a radically reorganized life course. This remarkable book redefines anthropology for the twenty-first century.”
- Joseph Masco, author of
The Future of Fallout, and Other Episodes in Radioactive World-Making
Reparations and the Human
David L. Eng
“No other work demonstrates the critical relevance of psychoanalysis to justice more powerfully than David L. Eng’s
Reparations and the Human
. Animating the intersections of postcolonial American studies, Black feminist and Indigenous critique of sovereignty, law, and the human, and Transpacific Cold War critique, Eng theorizes the psychic dimension of reparation with deep literary insight. A book anyone seeking a way beyond the nomos of the post-Enlightenment planet must read.”
- Lisa Yoneyama, author of
Cold War Ruins: Transpacific Critique of American Justice and Japanese War Crimes
Marx for Cats
Leigh Claire La Berge
“
Marx for Cats
is an undomesticated and indefinable meow de coeur. You can open this book anywhere---it's a Marxist Choose Your Own Adventure---and come away as unsettled, possessed, and reflective as any transportative encounter with a cat might leave you.”
- Jordy Rosenberg, author of
Confessions of the Fox
In the Wake
Christina Sharpe
"Christina Sharpe brings everything she has to bear on her consideration of the violation and commodification of Black life and the aesthetic responses to this ongoing state of emergency. Through her curatorial practice, Sharpe marshals the collective intellectual heft and aesthetic inheritance of the African diaspora to show us the world as it appears from her distinctive line of sight. A searing and brilliant work."
- Saidiya Hartman, author of
Lose Your Mother: A Journey Along the Atlantic Slave Route
Black Disability Politics
Sami Schalk
“Black disabled genius is crucial to the work of creating a free present and future. In
Black Disability Politics
, Sami Schalk does so much absolutely brilliant Black queer disabled femme labor of surfacing buried Black disabled activist histories and organizing lessons. Her book is a Black queer disabled love offering, and reading it made me shout for joy and learn so much. I’m so grateful this book is in the world. Read it and give thanks that we get to share the world with the brilliance of Schalk and the organizers she writes about—then get to work putting into practice the lessons you’ve learned, so we can win.”
- Leah Lakshmi Piepzna-Samarasinha, author of
Care Work: Dreaming Disability Justice
Raving
McKenzie Wark
“Passionately exploring queer rave culture,
Raving
is the fantasy and the moment. There are drugs and sex, tangled love affairs, rejection, the highs and lows of the dance floors, and all the messiness that makes up a rave evening. A potent book.”
- madison moore, author of
Fabulous: The Rise of the Beautiful Eccentric
Living a Feminist Life
Sara Ahmed
“From the moment I received Sara Ahmed’s new work,
Living a Feminist Life
, I couldn’t put it down. It’s such a brilliant, witty, visionary new way to think about feminist theory. Everyone should read this book. It offers amazing new ways of knowing and talking about feminist theory and practice. And, it is also delightful, funny, and as the song says, ‘your love has lifted me higher.’ Ahmed lifts us higher.”
- bell hooks
