About Our Department
Update: Emails to your Math accounts are now being forwarded to your Duke accounts.  Please check
https://mail.duke.edu
for incoming emails addressed to your @math.duke.edu account.  Email folders and files are still offline.  We will update you here when more informatoin is available.
Notice: We have a network problem since Wednesday (3/19/2025). Members of the department won't be able to access your files and email. MathJobs and AcademicJobsOnline sites are also inaccessible. We are working to get them restored ASAP. Sorry for the inconvenience.
With our award-winning faculty, nationally-recognized programs, and challenging but engaging curriculum, Duke's Department of Mathematics prepares students for successful careers – whether that's in a math field, academia, or a different area altogether.
For
undergraduates
, we offer both a Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science in Mathematics, as well as a minor. At the graduate level, our
Ph.D. program
has consistently been ranked among the top 20 nationally by
U.S. News & World Report
.
Our
research
spans theoretical to applied mathematics. Our
faculty
conduct more than $3.7 million in research each year for industry, the Department of Defense, the National Science Foundation, and the National Institutes of Health. We're proud to say our faculty includes four National Academy of Science members and two National Academy of Engineering members.
As a department, we are well aware that past and current injustices have prevented far too many people from living up to their mathematical potential. We know that our work as mathematicians cannot be complete unless all are given the genuine opportunity to succeed at mathematics, regardless of race, ethnicity, religion, national origin, gender identity, sexual orientation, or disability. We are committed to maintaining a department culture that is welcoming and nurturing to all.
