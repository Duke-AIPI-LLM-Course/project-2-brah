Our History
Explore More than 100 Years of Excellence in Engineering at Duke
Origins
Our lineage can be traced to the 19th century institutions that became Duke University.
Jump to Section
Duke University is Born
Our modern birth comes when J.B. Duke’s foresighted philanthropy transforms Trinity College into Duke University in 1924.
Jump to Section
A College of Engineering is Founded
J.B. Duke’s vision takes real form when university trustees establish the College of Engineering.
Jump to Section
Postwar Expansion
Major changes arrive with end of World War II. The College of Engineering moves into its first purpose-built home—the elegant Engineering Building.
Jump to Section
Rise to Prominence
Duke’s national and global leadership in biomedical engineering is established.
Jump to Section
Accelerating Growth and Development
In the 1980s and ’90s, the School of Engineering grows and develops with new facilities, becomes the home of the first NSF Engineering Research Center on biomedical research, and gains an endowment.
Jump to Section
Ready for Impact in the 21st Century
At the turn of the century, the accelerating speed of the organization is palpable. Evidence includes the opening of the 125,000-square-foot Fitzpatrick Center, which vastly expands research space in photonics, nanotechnologies and biomedical engineering.
Jump to Section
Engineering in Service to Society
As the Pratt School of Engineering becomes one of the fastest-rising engineering schools in the country, it sets sights on making major positive impacts—nationally and globally.

Origins
1851-1923
caption
The earliest record is an 1851 advertisement by Normal College in Randolph County, North Carolina, for a course including classical engineering. After funding by the Methodist Church, the institution is renamed Trinity College. By 1887, Trinity offers courses in civil engineering and mining engineering. Seeking expansion only an urban setting can provide, Trinity College moves to Durham, NC, in 1892.
Duke University is Born
1924
caption
Industrialist and philanthropist James B. Duke signs the
Indenture of Trust
that transforms Trinity College into Duke University. He charges the caretakers of the new institution to “uplift mankind” through teaching and research on subjects that “develop our resources, increase our wisdom and promote human happiness.” Duke specifies that the trustees establish “an Engineering School, as and when funds are available.”
1927
caption
Departments for civil engineering and electrical engineering are established.
Engineering is quartered on the Trinity campus. Classes and labs meet in the Asbury (pictured) and Bivins buildings. Engineering students live in “The Shack”—Southgate Hall.
1930s
The annual student-led Engineers Show becomes a popular event at Duke and in Durham. Technological marvels are displayed—including television, new forms of artificial lighting and “The Mystifier,” a machine which reveals a person’s height and weight.
1931
caption
The Department of Mechanical Engineering is established. Total engineering student enrollment exceeds 100.
1937
The engineering enterprise at Duke covers 30,000 square feet—six times greater than just a decade earlier. Enrollment exceeds 160 engineering students.
A College of Engineering is Founded
1939
The College of Engineering is formed, the third undergraduate college at the young university. Civil engineer William H. Hall, a 1907 alumnus and a faculty member since 1915, is the first dean. The engineering student body grows to 201. Five new professors nearly double the engineering faculty to 12.
1940
caption
The first issue of
The Duke Engineer
appears. The student-written magazine is renamed DukEngineer in 1941 and is
published annually
.
1943
The College of Engineering holds its first commencement exercises early, on April 12. Members of the inaugural class go into a variety of wartime efforts.
1946
caption
Electrical engineers Muriel Theodorsen Williams (left) and
Marie Foote Reel
(right) are the Duke College of Engineering’s first female graduates.
Reel graduates magna cum laude, and later works as engineering instructor at Texas A&M University and as chief specifications engineer for DeLeuw Cather, design consultants for the DC Metro.
Williams interrupts physics training at Duke to be one of 100 in a wartime engineering training program for women at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. At the war’s end, she returns to Duke and graduates from the College of Engineering. Later she works as a consultant in the calibration of precision tools.
Postwar Expansion
1948
caption
The College of Engineering moves to West Campus, taking up residence in the new red-brick Engineering Building.
1951
caption
North Carolina lawmakers pass an important early anti-pollution law.
William Brewster Snow
, a 1932 Duke graduate, a member of the engineering faculty and a leading sanitation engineer, founds a series of conferences that guide implementation of the new Stream Sanitation Law.
1957
The College of Engineering offers the first Master of Science degrees available at Duke.
1960
Duke is the first private institution in the Southeast to offer a PhD in electrical engineering.
1963
caption
Gene R. Kendall is the first Black undergraduate engineering student and one of
The First Five
undergraduates to integrate Duke.
Kendall leaves Duke in his sophomore year to study at the University of Kansas, where he completes bachelor’s and master’s engineering degrees and Navy Nuclear Power Training. At Kansas, Kendall is integral in establishing the Student Council for Recruiting, Motivating and Educating Black Engineers. He serves in the Navy for 35 years, rising to the rank of rear admiral.
1964
Duke begins offering a PhD in civil engineering.
Rise to Prominence
1966
In “recognition of its professional status and of the stature that it had achieved in its programs of graduate study and research,” Duke’s trustees elevate the college to the School of Engineering.
1967
caption
Mechanical engineering student C.B. Claiborne starts for the Blue Devils. He is the first Black player on the Duke men’s basketball team and scores 13 points in his debut, a win against Penn State. At Duke he is not spared the institutionalized racism of the era—including not receiving his varsity letter at the team’s awards banquet, which is held at a segregated country club.
Following graduation, Claiborne works for Westinghouse, Ford, Duke Power and Booz-Allen, earns advanced degrees from Dartmouth, Washington University in St. Louis, and Virginia Tech, and becomes a widely-published and award-winning scholar, educator and photographer.
1967
caption
Durham’s
Herald-Sun
reports that Duke’s new Division of Biomedical Engineering is founded “to train people for a new profession which requires more knowledge about medicine than is possessed by the average engineer and more knowledge in engineering than is possessed by the average doctor.” (Pictured, left to right, William Anlyan, James Meriam and Theo Pilkington)
1968
caption
The first Black students graduate from the Duke School of Engineering:
mechanical engineer Alfred J. Hooks (left), civil engineer Kenneth Spaulding Chestnut (right), and electrical engineer Charles Hall.
Hooks works for Caterpillar for 40 years, is active in public service in Peoria, Ill., and earns a pilot’s license. Chestnut rises as a leader in the global construction industry, later retiring as president and CEO of IBG Construction Services.
1971
caption
Biomedical Engineering becomes a full academic department at Duke—a first at an American university. In 1972, Duke is the first to offer an accredited undergraduate major in biomedical engineering.
1976
