Undergraduate Program
Our undergraduate program familiarizes you with the content and the structure of philosophical theory in various areas and with the history of philosophy. You are encouraged to actively engage in the philosophical examination of problems. Various fields of the arts and sciences raise philosophical questions which are often not given thorough attention in those particular disciplines. Through the informed consideration of such questions, you will acquire a broader and deeper understanding of the major areas of intellectual endeavor.
