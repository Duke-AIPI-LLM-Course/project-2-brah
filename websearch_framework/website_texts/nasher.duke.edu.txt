“Well, first of all, we love Jennings. With her eye and the work that she’s done with stores in the community, it’s going to be, for the first time, really a reflection of our identity as a museum, because she understands it. And even the way it looks as a space – not to mention the merchandise – it just changes things dramatically. We’re super excited.” – Nasher Museum Director Trevor Schoonmaker in the summer issue of Durham magazine.
