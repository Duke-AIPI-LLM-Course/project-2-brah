Outstanding Research Facilities
The Wilkinson Building
This 150,000-square-foot transformational facility embodies our vision of collaborative research. Lab spaces are grouped into research neighborhoods focused on advances in health, computing and the environment. Dedicated PhD student working spaces feature large exterior windows and campus views.
Quantum Computing Cluster
With $80-million-plus in external funding, Duke ECE’s internationally recognized quantum computing team—part of the Duke Quantum Center—is developing trapped ion qubit technologies.
Materials Fabrication Cleanrooms
Our NSF-affiliate Shared Materials Instrumentation Facility (SMiF) is home to 4,000 square feet of class 100 and class 1000 cleanroom, and well-stocked suites of the latest instruments for materials and device characterization, imaging and analysis.
Robotics Workspace
Duke’s multidisciplinary robotics working group has access to simulation and robotics platforms, two experiment rooms for private human-in-the-loop experiments, an observation room and adjacent office space for graduate students.
Build Your Mentoring Muscles
We train tomorrow’s engineering leaders, and leaders need to, well, lead. And thoughtful, deliberate mentorship is a key ingredient. Start honing those skills now.
It’s a hallmark of the Duke Engineering experience that our undergrads partake in authentic research experiences and that our PhD students mentor undergraduates in research skills.
It doesn’t happen by accident. PhD research projects and engaged undergrads are matched through Muser, a savvy online system.
