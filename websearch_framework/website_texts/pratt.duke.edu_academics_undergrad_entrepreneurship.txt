Student Entrepreneurship
More than a Skill. A Mindset.
Creating impact is about more than mastering a set of skills. It’s a way of looking at the world. Engaged engineers need to understand how solutions will affect communities beyond their clients and how to design products that people will choose to use.
That’s where developing an entrepreneurial mindset comes in. Through engaging programs and inspiring active-learning spaces, you can develop a lifelong entrepreneurial approach based in ethics, problem-solving and value creation.
Active Learning
EGR 102: Design 2 Deliver
Continue refining the solution you created in First-Year Design. Offered as a half-credit, satisfactory/unsatisfactory course. There’s big potential for big impact—multiple medical device prototypes developed in this course have found funding, and one has already entered clinical testing.
BME Design Fellows
Undergraduates in biomedical engineering (BME) at Duke can enroll in this intensive medical technology design program, culminating with students designing solutions to clinical needs identified by Duke University Medical Center doctors and nurses.
Duke Innovation & Entrepreneurship
Around campus, it’s called I&E. It’s Duke’s community of innovators. Many Duke engineering students earn I&E’s intensive undergraduate certificate.
Character Forward
Powered by investments from the Kern Family Foundation and the Purpose Project at Duke, we’re embedding deep explorations of character and ethics throughout the curriculum.
Garages for Ideas, Not Cars
You need a place to build, and Duke has spaces for that, bristling with tools and prototyping technology. (
Well, sometimes our garage labs hold cars. You’ve got to tinker with your Guinness World Record high-efficiency vehicle somewhere.
)
Meet ‘Maxwell’
The Foundry
Just down Science Drive, beneath Gross Hall, you’ll find a 7,600-square-foot maker space dedicated to helping students build their ideas from the ground up. A tinkerer’s toy shop, it boasts an array of advanced tools, including direct metal printing.
Wilkinson Garage Labs
Flexible, tool-filled design/build spaces on the main level of the Wilkinson Building feature floor-to-ceiling exterior doors that open onto a wide patio. When you visit, let our students show you around.
Co-Lab Studio
Our neighbor just across Telcom Drive is a technology engagement center filled with prototyping equipment, including laser cutting, laser sintering using nylon powder and a king-sized polymer 3D printer with a build volume of two cubic feet.
Christensen Family Center for Innovation
A hub for students who want to solve problems, one product at a time.
