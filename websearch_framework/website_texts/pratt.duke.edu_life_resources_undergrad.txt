Undergraduate Student Resources
Duke Engineering Is First and Foremost a Community
Engineering school is kind of like riding a horse. If you’re comfortable the whole time you’re doing it, you’re probably doing it wrong.
Our engineering school community values its members. We look out for each other. The programs and resources we provide to our undergraduates are important parts of that commitment. It’s our mission to give you the reins, and to help you get back in the saddle if you fall.

Support for the Whole Person
From Your Advising Team
Your 360 coach, academic dean and departmental advisor are there to help you identify and pursue your academic interests and personal goals. Through targeted referrals, these trained experts open doors to a broad array of resources across Duke.
From Every Part of Duke
Duke Student Affairs keeps a constantly updated list of student resources, from maintaining health and wellness to connecting with a diverse range of identities and cultures.
From Our Global Community of Alumni
With just a click, you can send a question to nearly 15,000 Duke Engineering graduates, each one somebody who once sat where you’re sitting. Give the ‘Ask a Blue Devil’ portal a try.

Student Assistance Programs
Thanks to the generosity of donors in the Duke Engineering Community, no eligible undergraduate has to miss an educational opportunity just because a cost is not covered by financial aid.
Maclin Endowment Fund
Created through the generosity of Valecia Maclin, Class of 1992, the Maclin Endowment Fund provides grants that make a difference for eligible students—from computer repair to educational travel.
WIN Empowerment Fund
Students can apply to the WIN Empowerment Fund for grants to cover opportunity-broadening expenses such as graduate exam fees and conference attendance.
Conference Grants
We help our students share their research discoveries with the world by providing small grants to help with the costs of attending scientific conferences.
