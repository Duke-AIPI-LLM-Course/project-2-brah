Life at Duke
In a Word, Life Is Good.
A spectacular vista greets every visitor to Duke’s campus–the long, verdant stretch of Chapel Drive topped by the elegant tower of Duke Chapel.
The wordless message communicated is clear: great things happen here.

Embracing the Whole Person
The Pratt School of Engineering is a highly ranked engineering school in a top 10 research university with a strong liberal arts tradition. That’s a rare and powerful mix.

It is a beautiful place to learn, teach and work. Here, you’ll find resources to support you, clubs and organizations to inspire you, and teams to cheer to victory.

Go Blue Devils!
More than a mascot, the Blue Devil personifies the Duke spirit.
The character’s origin is not infernal, but French. A century ago students took inspiration from stylish Alpine troopers whose grit earned them the nickname
les Diables Bleus

You’re Gonna Like it Here
There’s more to life than schoolwork and paperwork. In Durham and the NC Triangle, you’re a morning’s ride from Blue Ridge mountains or Atlantic beaches. Stay home to enjoy ballpark fare or award-winning cuisine. Make art. Make a difference. Be you.
