Welcome to OARC
Office of Audit, Risk and Compliance
Duke | OARC
We provide assurance and compliance program services across the entire institution, including Duke University, Duke University Health System, and DUMAC.
As a service provider within Duke, we consider first the needs of our stakeholders.  With this approach, we foster open and collaborative relationships, risk-focused engagement and opportunities to identify improvements to governance, financial and operational processes and procedures.  Communication with our stakeholders and staff development support our mission to advance and integrate risk awareness, internal controls and compliance requirements as well as to collaborate on proactive and innovative improvements to business processes.
OARC's charter charges the office with performing independent internal audits, planning and overseeing the university risk management process, and overseeing the institutional ethics and compliance program.  It is designed to help fulfill the fiduciary responsibilities of the Duke governing boards.
Governance Structure and Independence
To ensure OARC's independence, the chief audit, risk and compliance officer reports administratively to the president of the university and the chancellor for health affairs, and functionally to the boards and audit committees.
