About Us
The Department of Religious Studies explores the social organization and impact of religion in ancient and modern cultures through critical theory, literary and visual studies.
Our students come to understand the basics of different belief systems; the history of religion; the related philosophies; interpretations of ancient texts; the material practices involved; and how religion intersects with journalism, culture, business, and contemporary politics. This not only gives them a sense of their place as an individual in our global society, but also offers perspective to navigate any career they choose to pursue.
