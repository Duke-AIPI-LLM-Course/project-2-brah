Design Experience
Feature Story
Amid the seriousness of coursework, Duke students took on the admittedly silly challenge of designing an amphibious sculpture — for credit.
Their classrooms: a tool-filled maker space, a Division I aquatics center and the streets of Baltimore. See how our campus environment engages and inspires.

Acclimating to University Life
We warmly welcome new international students with a picnic on North Carolina’s pristine Eno River — setting them on the path to success in a supportive environment.
Focusing on Health & Wellness
At Duke, help is never far away. Rare for an engineering school, our graduate students can access staff experts certified by the National Board for Health & Wellness Coaching.
Widening Career Horizons
We pioneered authentic career exploration for PhD students. Our program expands career possibilities that inspire graduates to lead in industry and public policy.
