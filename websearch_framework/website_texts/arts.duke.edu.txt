“An Oak Tree” at Duke: Tim Crouch’s Residency Connects Students, Faculty, and Alumni
“It feels wild to travel nearly 4,000 miles to find your audience. I sometimes fear that theater is facing an existential threat, but then Duke Arts gave me two full houses and an enthusiastic response. Theater is alive!”
—Tim Crouch
