Connections Forged, For a Lifetime
Connections forged at Duke last. Our graduates join a global community that provides lifelong support.
Duke’s authentic connections with 17,000-plus graduates endure and deepen over time—evidenced by alumni mentorship of today’s students and an uncommonly high rate of annual giving.
Give to the Annual Fund
Support need-based financial aid, teaching and mentoring, and hands-on design learning. Or make a gift that can be applied to any vital need.
Make a Gift
I give to the Engineering Annual Fund to help students who may not have the financial means to attend Duke. I want them to have the same opportunity that I had to live out my dreams of attending Duke and graduating with a degree in biomedical engineering.
