About Us
Duke’s History Department —among the top programs in the country —regards the creation of knowledge as one of the fundamental missions of a research university. Our
world-renowned faculty
, who work closely with our students and collaborate with colleagues across disciplines, are at the cutting edge of
research in their fields
as they address society’s greatest challenges. And our
graduate
and
undergraduate
academic programs —designed to help students critically think about the world around them —successfully prepare students for a wide range of careers.
We are committed to drawing upon our historical knowledge to collectively create and foster a more inclusive, just, and equitable society for all. We condemn racial violence and hatred, in all its forms locally and globally. We stand in solidarity with families who have lost their loved ones and all those who are exercising their constitutional right to assemble and protest against racial injustice and discrimination.
Statement of Solidarity Against Anti-Asian Violence
In the wake of the murderous attack on Asian American women in Atlanta, Ga., and incidents of hate that include physical assault, civil rights violations, and
harassment of several thousand Asian Americans
and Asians in the United States, the Duke History community condemns the scapegoating and ethnic-based and racial hatred that has proliferated in this country over the last year.
As historians, we have studied the emergence and reproduction of racist ideas
in this country and across the globe
. We know the long-enduring impact of bigotry and racism that have targeted Asians and Asian American people since the mid-nineteenth century, unleashing hurt and harm.
