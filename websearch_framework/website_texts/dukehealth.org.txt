On the Move Again After Chronic Total Occlusion
Mitchell Doub, 64, could barely walk across his living room without experiencing debilitating chest pain thanks to an advanced form of
coronary artery disease
called
chronic total occlusion
. After Doub was told nothing could be done, Duke Health’s
Islam M. Othman, MD
, offered a solution. Dr. Othman performed a complex catheterization procedure that opened Doub’s blocked artery and gave him immediate symptom relief. Now Doub is back to working out and looking forward to an upcoming trip to Colorado. “If you have a chronic total occlusion, don't walk; run to Duke,” he said.
