Let me tell you a story…
University Communications and Marketing is an award-winning team of storytellers, creative producers, and media strategists dedicated to advancing the university’s mission through powerful storytelling and outreach.
We partner with and support a dynamic network of communicators who work in units throughout the university and Health System to engage audiences on campus and far beyond with stories that educate and inspire.
We aim to create, engage and amplify the Duke community’s dedication to improving lives through education, research and patient care.  It is our privilege to share this work with the world.
