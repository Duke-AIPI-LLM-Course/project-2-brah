Welcome from the VP
The Division of Student Affairs supports over 16,000 Duke undergraduate, graduate and professional students and engages tens of thousands of visitors, families, and members of the Duke community every year. Our team includes more than 800 dining staff, 200 housekeepers, 100 clinicians and care providers, and scores of student development specialists, event coordinators, residential coordinators, career advisers and operations experts.  We partner with student leaders and faculty on the Durham and Beaufort campuses throughout the calendar year.
Our primary job is to ensure Duke students have the resources and support they need to arrive at their classes and laboratories ready to engage in critical thinking and learning each day. We also help Blue Devils gain skills and insight about themselves and the world - and we take great pride in helping future leaders tackle obstacles, flourish, and make the most of their Duke experience.  Through a wide range of programs and offices– from undergraduate new student and family programs to career advising, from venue management and the box office to
QuadEx
, student leader advising, and student-programs and initiatives in our
Identity and Cultural Centers
, we love being a part of our students’ individual journeys and fostering excellence across Duke.
We’re glad you’re here!
Yours,
Mary Pat McMahon
Vice Provost and Vice President of Student Affairs
